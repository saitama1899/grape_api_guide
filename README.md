> The point of this project is to learn how to use grape, define its tools, and as documentation for anyone who wants to understand how the core of the [main project](https://github.com/assimovt/badigeeks-api) will work.
>
> Good practices that I'll recommend following this project and any project:
> - Try to write always the test.
> - Working and implementing little and functional steps everytime.
> - After that, commit and push with a clear description with that what you done.
>
> This readme.md could also be as example to how to document with Markdown a readme file
